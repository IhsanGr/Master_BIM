**AAGB :** This course was separated in two themes.  
           The first one was about learning how to code in C. We learned many things in order to make us understand and practice low-level programming language.  
           The second one made us learn and implement many algorithms on phylogenic trees.  
           On this repertory you'll find my work done in C language and Python language even if we used Jupyter notebook for the last one.

**MAPSI :** On this you will find some code about Machine Learning and especially some algorithms such as EM, Viterbi, etc that we coded in Python.

**Physiology Project :** A course of the first semester, this is basically the same repertory as before.
