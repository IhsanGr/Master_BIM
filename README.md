**[Master Bio-Informatique et Modélisation](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/BIM/index.html#debouches)**  
On this repository you'll find a few parts of my work during my two years of master degree.

**Dot Plot :** The goal of the project was to developp a tool to compare a pair of bacterias genomes choosed by the user. Informations of these genomes would be stored in psql DataBase.  
               We uses a BLASTp to compare the genome based on many criterias such as sequence identity, sequence covery, etc.  
               Then the dotplot shows on a graphic the similarities between the two genomes. 
               For more informations feel free to contact me on my email.
